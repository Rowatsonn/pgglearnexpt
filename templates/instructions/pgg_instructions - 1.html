        <p>During this part of the study, each round you will be given <strong>10</strong> units of lab money and you must decide how much of this, if any, to donate to a public fund. This public fund will then be doubled and split evenly amongst all players. Then, anything that you earn from the public fund, as well as any lab money you <strong>did not</strong> donate to the public fund will be added to your overall total. At the end of the game, the lab money you collected will be converted to real money, which will be then added to what you will receive from completing the study.</p>

        <p>On the following page, there will be a further explanation of the game and an animated picture to help you understand how the game works and how each participant scores depending on their behaviour.</p>

        <h1>Part Two</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>During this part of the study, each round you will be given <strong>10</strong> units of "lab money" and you must decide how much of this, if any, to donate to a public fund. This public fund will then be doubled and split evenly amongst all players. Then, anything that you earn from the public fund, as well as any money you <strong>did not</strong> donate to the public fund will be added to your overall total.
	</p>
	<p>However, after everyone has donated, if the <strong>total</strong> in the public fund is <strong>less than 10</strong> then everybody's earnings become <strong>0</strong> for that round. At the end of the game, the lab money you collected will be converted to real money, which will be then added to what you will receive from completing the study.</p>
