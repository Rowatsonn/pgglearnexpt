        <p>During this part of the study, each round you will be given <strong>10</strong> lab points and you must decide how much of this, if any, to donate to a public fund. This public fund will then be doubled and split evenly amongst all players. Then, anything that you earn from the public fund, as well as any money you <strong>did not</strong> donate to the pot will be added to your overall score. At the end of the game, all players will receieve a bonus payout determined by their score during the game.</p>

        <p>Before proceeding, there will be three examples to help you understand how the game works which will explain how each participant will score depending on their behavior.</p>
