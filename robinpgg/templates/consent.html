			<h5>Researchers and contact details:</h5>
	
			<p>Robin Watson (robin.o.watson@durham.ac.uk)</p>

			<p>You are invited to take part in a study conducted by a postgraduate research student at the University of Durham, supervised By Dr. Rachel Kendal, Dr. Jeremy Kendal and Dr. Julie Van-De-Vyver. This study has receieved ethical approval from the Department of Anthropology.</p>

			<p>Before taking part, please read the following information carefully which will explain the purpose of the research and what is involved for you as a participant. If you would like any additional information, or there is anything which is not clear, please get in touch using the contact details above.</p>

			<h5>What is the purpose of the study?</h5>

			<p>The aim of this project is to better understand how human social behaviour might have evolved within group contexts.</p>

			<h5>Do I have to take part?</h5>

			<p>Your participation in this research is entirely voluntary. If you do agree to take part, you may withdraw from the study by closing the browswer window. However, if you do so, you will be ineligible for compensation. Once you have completed the study and your responses have been recorded, it will not be possible for you to withdraw.</p>

			<p>Please note that this is a multiplayer experiment and you will be taking part together with other participants. As such, please be aware that if you fail to advance forward in the study in a timely manner then you may lose your place in the experiment. This too, will render you ineligible for compensation.</p>

			<h5>What will happen to me if I take part?</h5>

			<p>If you agree to take part you will be asked to complete an online multiplayer experiment which should take around 10 minutes to complete. You will first take part in a general knowledge quiz in which you must select the correct answer out of a possible 3. You will then play a money game which, depending on your score, will affect how much you will earn from this experiment. Your score in the quiz <strong>will not</strong> affect your final payment.</p>

			<p>To keep the experiment moving forwards, you will only have a limited time to make your decision in each case, so make sure to answer quickly. The time you have available to answer will be displayed at the top corner of the page. Before the experiment starts, there may be a short delay while you wait for other participants to join. A live counter will show how many people have already joined and how many are required. While you are waiting, please do not close or minimise the page as the study will begin automatically once enough participants have arrived.</p>

		<h5>What will happen to the data collected in this experiment?</h5>

		<p>During the study, no personal information will be collected at any point. All participants will be kept entirely anonymous and it will be impossible to identify any individuals who have taken part. At the end of the study, the anonymised data may be shared with others for legitimate research purposes.</p>
